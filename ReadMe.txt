Hi All, 
This Repo is created for my personal use for hosting some of my personal experiments in cpp.

Feel free to fork it and play with it. ;) 
Thanks.

PS: This repo was created on a windows machine. The code itself is written using stl/standard libraries for cpp, so shouldn't create a problem on linux, but you'll need to write your own Makefile.
