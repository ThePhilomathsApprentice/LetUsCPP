# Hi All,
### This Repo is created for my personal use for hosting some of my personal experiments in cpp.

### Feel free to clone it and play with it. ;)
### Thanks.

### PS: The code itself is written using stl/standard libraries for cpp, so shouldn't create a problem on linux, but you'll need to write your own Makefile.
